TO-DO: figure out best way to handle data files that have results from
       multiple runs from different relevances.

filtering data:
	1. remove the log lines for training set and FULL Island
	   cat <raw-data-files> | grep -v "^Overall" | grep -v "^Island" | grep -v "FULL TEST SET Island" > FTO<unique-identifying-tag>
	2. extract just the data fields we want
	   cat FTO<uit> | awk ' /FULL/ {print $13, $7, $33, $37, $41, $45, $49, $53, $57, $61, $70, $74, $78, $82, $66}; !/FULL/ {print $0}' > distilledFTO-<uit>
	3. manually edit <distilled-FULLOveral>: remove blank lines between cycles 
	   within single relevance setting.  NOTE: when 'cycles' with different relevance weights 
	   reside within the same data file, this will need to be split apart.
	4. compute averages using averages.pl perl script
	   cat <MODIFIED-distilled-FULLOverall> | ./averages.pl > <agvs-gnuplot-file>


select-0/:
	no bias toward fitness or diversity;
	uniform random selection

select-1/:
	tournament selection with no diversity;
	tournament size = 5 (?)

select-3/:
	phenotype diversity with weights of 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25

select-4/:
	(estimated) hamming distance diversity with different weights of 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25


avgs-all.gp:
	index 0: tournament selection -- no diversity
	index 1: phenotype selection, weight 1.0
	index 2: phenotype selection, weight 0.75
	index 3: phenotype selection, weight 0.5
	index 4: phenotype selection, weight 0.25
	index 5: (est.) hamming selection, weight 1.0
	index 6: (est.) hamming selection, weight 0.75
	index 7: (est.) hamming selection, weight 0.5
	index 8: (est.) hamming selection, weight 0.25
	index 9: proportionate selection -- no diversity

Field:
1 generation (13)
2 overall most fit (7)
3 max fitness diversity (33)
4 min fitness diversity (37)
5 avg fitness diversity (41)
6 var fitness diversity (45)
7 max phenotype diversity (49)
8 min phenotype diversity (53)
9 avg phenotype diversity (57)
10 var phenotype diversity (61)
11 max est. hamming div (70)
12 min est. hamming div (74)
13 avg est. hamming div (78)
14 var est. hamming div (82)
15 TI w/ no weight (66)

Gnuplot commands:-
	plot 'avgs-all.gp' index 0 using 1:2 w lines t "fitness only", 'avgs-all.gp' index 1 using 1:2 w lines t "phenotype wgt 1.0", 'avgs-all.gp' index 5 using 1:2 w lines t "hamming wgt 1.0"
	change index and title (t) as needed
